Info:
macros to read all root-files with signal and background, write datafiles with significance and numbers of s & b after cuts (propto efficiencies).
eventually to do: write also efficiencies.

Unpack:
tar -pzvxf packge.tar.gz .
eventually chmod ugo+x main.sh .
change paths to signal and background root-files.
change *.h files and Makefile to set paths do root and Delphes. Works in dezero.uniandes.

Run: 
./main.sh 
tells you which variables are needed as input. F.i. 
./main.sh 100 200 1 10 0
scans MF between MassFi=100 and MassFf=200 in steps of (default 5, see main.sh)
and DeltaM between 1 and 10 in steps of (default 1, see main.sh);
reads cross-sections in main.sh (works with the XS written in main.sh, could change 0 by any cross-section in fb).
reads file with cuts: cutsinfo10095.dat=cutsinfo10095_orig.dat. Modify cuts there. 
!!! Beware !!!: cut in nuber of jets is here <= , not <. 
Modify eventually in scan.cc , or replace by Newfiles/scan.cc (also, change in cut-flow order, same results).
(scan.cc.orig = scan.cc in this tarball).
here:                  if (Numjets<=njetscut[i2]) {
in Newfiles/scan.cc:   if (Numjets<njetscut[i5]) {       #use cutsinfo10095_newfiles.dat

Output:
nsignalnp.dat: nunpy dataframe with number of signal events for every scneario. ( format [[DeltaMi&MFi, ....,DeltaMf&MFi],[],...[DeltaMf&MFf]]).
significancenp.dat: same for significance.

Options: 
Background=1 (default) reads background and signal. 
Background=0 reads only signal root-files, reads background *total.dat files (works if already run with Background=1 with exactly those cuts, else leads to incorrect results).
Background=-1 reads both signal and background from *total.dat files.

==========================================
additional files not needed for main.sh == scanloop_xs.sh :

... to be added here later .... read more than one root-file for any given parameter point.
